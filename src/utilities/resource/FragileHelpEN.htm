<p>Thanks for using Fragile! This document will help to familiarize you with the functions of Fragile, and show you all that fragile has to offer.
Fragile is a modern, easy-to-use mixed-fraction calculator, created by Sagacious Media. With Fragile, you can do functions such as adding, subtracting,
multiplying, and dividing fractions, whole numbers, and mixed numbers, doing long-running calculations from a single start point, comparing two numbers with relational operators, 
and view graphical representations of your data, all from the convenience of a single app! We're so glad you're with us, so let's get started.</p>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center"> A Guide to the Fragile User Interface</p>

<p>Fragile contains a simple, easy-to-use graphical interface that makes inputting mixed fractions, modifying inputs, and viewing results of calculations a breeze.
Let's run down a few of the components of the user interface.</p>

<p style="font-size:300%; text-align: center">The Display:</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="display.png" alt="Display Help"></p>

<p>Fragile contains a display to make seeing mixed fractions easier, but it can be a little daunting if you don't know where to start. Don't worry; the
display is much simpler than it looks! The area in the red circle is where stored operands (fractions, whole numbers, mixed numbers) and operations go. Once you enter a fraction and press an operation button or enter 2 fractions and press enter, the current operation and answer will be stored up there. The area in the green circle is where you enter your current
operand. Once you are done entering your operand, pressing an operation button or equals will move it into to the red circle area. The hollow black rectangle in the
green circle is called a focus indicator. It tells you where your input is currently going. Any inputs you make will be put in the place of the focus indicator.</p>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center">The Numberpad:</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="numbers.png" alt="Numpad Buttons"></p>

<p>Fragile contains a numberpad with the numbers 0-9 to allow for the simple input of fractions. To use these numbers, simply click on them, and Fragile will add them in
their appropriate place.</p>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center"> Operators and Positioning Buttons:</p>

<p>Fragile's user interface also contains buttons for inputting the intended operation, deleting inputs, and clearing the display. Let's go through a few of them now:</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="operators.png" alt="Operator Buttons"></p>

<p>Operators: Addition(+), Subtraction(-), Multiplication(X), and Division(÷) buttons allow you to do all common mathematical operations with your inputs. The invert button (Inv) will invert the currently entered item (such as 3/2 becoming 2/3). The simplify button (↡) will simplify a currently entered fraction if possible (such as 1 2/6 becoming 1 1/3). The mediant button (⇹) will compute the mediant of two mixed numbers or fractions, which involves summing the numerators of the two fractions and dividing that by the sum of the two denominators (such as 2 2/3 ⇹ 1 1/2=2 1/5). The integer power button (xⁿ) will raise an input to an integer power (such as 5 xⁿ 2=10). The relational operators (>, <, and ≝) allow for two entries to be compared to determine which is bigger (such as 5 > 2 =True).</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="deletion.png" alt="Removal Buttons"></p>

<p>Removal: Reset(R), Clear(C), and Backspace(<-) all allow for modification of inputs. Reset will delete the entire current expression. Clear will delete the current
mixed fraction. The backspace button will delete the digit to the left of the focus icon. Please note that these modifications are permanent, so take
care when using the modification buttons to avoid accidental data loss.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="fraction.png" alt="Position Button"></p>

<p>Position: The position button, represented as a box over another box, will move your current input field. For example, if you have just inputted a whole number, and you press
the position button, your current input field will now be moved to the numerator of the fraction to the right of the last inputted whole number.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="equals.png" alt="Equals Button"><img src="sign.png" alt="Sign Button"></p>

<p>Equals and Sign: The equals("=") button will calculate the result of the currently entered fractions and operators. The sign button (±) will change the sign of the current mixed fraction, from negative to positive and vice versa.</p>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center">The Toolbar</h5>

<p>Fragile contains a toolbar at the top of the user interface which contains multiple useful functions. Let's go over them now.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="toolbar.png" alt="Toolbar"></p>

<p>The toolbar contains six main sections: File, Mode, View, Help, Preferences, and Separators. These six sections can be pressed on to show additional sub-menus with more functions. To start, let's look into the File section.

<p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center">The File Menu</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="filemenu.png" alt="File-Print Session-New Calculator-Exit"></p>

<p>The File menu contains three selections:Print Session, New Calculator, and Exit; Print session is a way to print a history of all math calculations done during this session. New Calculator will create another window of Fragile with default preferences loaded. When the exit button is pressed, Fragile will close, so be careful!</p>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center">The Print Session Menu</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="printdialog.png" alt="Print Display"></p>

<p>The print session button opens up a dialog that allows you to print the session history, which stores all of the computations you have executed during the current session.</p>

<p>The new calculator button will open another window of Fragile. This new Fragile window and any existing windows will be completely independent of one another, and operations done on one calculator will not affect any other calculators. The new Fragile window will be loaded with default preferences, but a preference file can be loaded for each window independently.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%;">The Mode Menu</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="mode.png" alt="Mode Menu"></p>

<p>The Mode Menu specifies how results of computations are displayed. When "Proper" is checked, all results will be shown as a proper fraction.
When "Reduced" is checked, all fractional results will be in their least possible form.</p>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center">The View Menu</p>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center"><img src="view.png" alt="View-Piechart"></p>

<p>The View menu also contains a single selection: Pie Chart; When this button is pressed, the Pie Chart menu will open, which will show a representation of
the current fraction as a pie chart.</p>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center">The Help Menu</p>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center"><img src="help.png" alt="Help-About-Help"></p>

<p>The Help menu contains two sections: About, which brings up an about page with information on Fragile, and Help, which opens this HTML help page.</p>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center">The Preferences Menu</p>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center"><img src="preferences.png" alt="Preferences"></p>

<p>The Preference Menu contains three sections: Edit, which allows the setting of keybindings and if the thousands separator should be on or off, Open, which allows you to open a preference file for use inside Fragile, and Save, which allows you to save your currently set preferences for future use. Let's take a closer look at setting and using keybinds.</p>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center"><img src="preferencesmenu.png" alt="Preference Menu"></p>

<p>The edit preference menu allows for keybinds to be set. In this menu, a menu item can be selected from the drop-down menu. Once an item is selected in the drop-down menu, press the button that says "Record." This will cause Fragile to start recording key presses. Simply press record and press a key, and Fragile will set that key to be the shortcut button for the selected menu item. To use the shortcut, press "Alt" and the key you set. You can also set the thousands separator from here.</p>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center"><img src="openmenu.png" alt"Open Menu"></p>

<p> The open menu allows you to load a previously saved preference file. Simply navigate to the desired file and select it, and Fragile will load the preferences in for use. Please note that you can only use files ending in .fpf.</p>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center"><img src="savemenu.png" alt="Save Menu"></p>

<p>The save menu allows you to save your currently saved preferences as a .fpf file. Simply select your desired directory, enter a name, and Fragile will save your preferences. Fragile will also save the set preferences under FragileDefaults/defaults.fpf, which can be found in your home directory. These defaults will be loaded whenever Fragile is run, but will not be loaded if the "New Calculator" button is used.</p>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center">The Separators Menu</p>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center"><img src="separators.png" alt="Separator Menu"></p>

<p>The separators menu allows for separators to be added or removed to numbers that are larger that 999. To use them, simply press the "On" button, and Fragile will add the separators to your number to make viewing more easy</p>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center"><img src="separatorson.png" alt="Separators On"></p>

<h2 style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center">Using the Pie Chart Window</h2>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma;">Fragile contains a function for visualizing fractions in the form of a pie chart, as well as showing expressions as a sequence of pie charts. Let's use it now. For this example, we've input a fraction of 2 and 1/2. Let's see what happens when we press the pie chart button under View - Pie Chart.</p>
 
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="piechartsingle.png" alt="Pie Chart Window With Single Pie Chart"></p>

<p style="font-family:Tahoma;"> Notice that a window has popped up. In the window, we have a text representation of our mixed fraction, as well as a pie 
chart representation of it. Let's try an equation, like 15 1/2 - 2 2/3.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="piechartdouble.png" alt="15 1/2 - 2 2/3 Pie Chart"></p>

<h3 style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center">Using Fragile</h3>

<p>Let's work through a sample use case for Fragile. In this example, we will enter "5 2/6," then use the simplify button to change "5 2/6" to "5 1/3," then we'll press "-" and enter 1 1/2, and then we'll press equals to get "3 5/6." Let's do this now.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="step1.png" alt="Step 1"></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="step2.png" alt="Step 2"></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="step3.png" alt="Step 3"></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="step4.png" alt="Step 4"></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="step5.png" alt="Step 5"></p>

<p>This seems like a perfect time to explain the session history and intermediate steps windows. Let's do that now</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%">The Session History Display</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="sessionhistory.png" alt="Session History"</p>

<p>When the arrow (>) button is pressed on the right side, the session history display will pop out. This display shows every computation done in this window of Fragile.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%">The Intermediate Steps Display</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="intermediatesteps.png" alt="Intermediate Steps"></p>

<p>When the arrow (<) button is pressed on the left side, the intermediate steps display will pop out. This display shows the steps taken to reach an answer, along with explanations on how that conclusion was reached</p>

<h4 style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size:300%; text-align: center">Relational Operations</h4>

<p>Fragile includes the capability to do relational operations. Let's walk through one now. We will compare 5 2/3 to 5 1/2 and see which one is bigger. Enter "5 2/3" as your first operand, and press the greater than sign (>). This will set Fragile into relational operation mode. Next, enter "5 1/2" and press enter (=). This will open a pop-up window that will show the outcome of the relational operation. In this case, "5 2/3" is greater than "5 1/2".

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="relationaloperator.png" alt="Result of Relational Operation"></p>

<p>Fragile includes greater than (>) which evaluates if the first operand is greater than the second, less than (<) which evaluates if the first operand is less than the second, and equal to (≝) which evaluates if the first and second operands are equal.</p>

<p style"text-align: center; font-size:150%;">We hope that this guide has informed you of Fragile's use. Thank you again for using Fragile, and happy Calculating!</p>
