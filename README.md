# 🧮 fragile-calculator

A calculator that works... most of the time.

## About

`fragile-calculator` is a Java-based calculator application with an HTML front end. It handles the core arithmetic you'd expect — just maybe not as reliably as you'd hope.

## Tech Stack

- **Java** — core calculation logic
- **HTML** — user interface

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher

### Running the App

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaufmajx/fragile-calculator.git
   cd fragile-calculator
   ```

2. Compile the Java source files:
   ```bash
   javac src/*.java
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   java -cp src Main
   ```

4. Open the HTML file in your browser if using the web interface:
   ```bash
   open src/index.html
   ```

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
